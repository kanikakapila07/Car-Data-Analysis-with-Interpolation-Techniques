The Auto MPG dataset is a dataset from the UCI Machine Learn-
ing Repository that contains information about various cars, including their miles per gallon
(MPG), cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, origin, and
car name. You can access the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data 

The project explores a dataset containing various attributes of cars, focusing on the correlation between vehicle weight and fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG).
applies several interpolation methods, including Vandermonde Matrix, Lagrange Interpolation, and Newton Interpolation, to fit polynomials to the data. The results are plotted to compare the interpolated polynomials against the original data, providing insights into the different methods' accuracy and behavior.
